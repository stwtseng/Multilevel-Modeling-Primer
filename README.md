# Description

This respository contains the presentation slides, handouts, and R code used to simulate data and generate graphs for a brief primer on multilevel modeling presented to graduate students in business administration at the University of Nevada, Reno.

The R code was borrowed from Michael Freeman and inspired by [his wonderful webpage](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/) that introduces hierarchical models.
